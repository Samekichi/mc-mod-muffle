# Muffle

> A minecraft mod which adds the Sound Muffler, a block which mutes nearby sounds.

## Future possibilities

- An extended version of the sound muffler, which allows for selectively muting some sounds or changing the range.
- the opposite, a Sound Amplifier, which makes sounds louder

There are WIP branches for both, but they don't quite work yet.
The GUI one needs to implement some networking for the UI to actually change the block entity, and the amplifier branch works but only up to the volume of 1.0 since it is capped there later. With some mixins this can be changed, although I'm not sure what the best way forward is there.

Contributions very welcome ðŸŒˆ
